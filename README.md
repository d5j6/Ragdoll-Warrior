# Ragdoll Warrior

A 2.5D Platform Fighter currently in development for mobile devices using the Unity engine.

This silly physics based game bends all the laws of physics, pushing the Unity Physics Engine and mobile devices to the extent of their abilities. The game features a dual joystick on-screen input system, with the left stick moving the player left and right, and the right stick controlling the player character's arm which wields a sword.

Players navigate along rooftops and platforms with the goal of defeating all the enemies, collecting all the drops, and completing the stage with as high a score as possible. Both the player and the enemy can be thrown into ragdoll mode unexpectedly and unpredictably upon taking damage, leading to hillarious and fun gameplay experiences.

Future plans include:
- Multiplayer Battles
- Leaderboards
- Large variety of worlds, areas and stages for the player to explore
- PC port with controller support as a testbed for console viability
- Expansion of characters, story, lore and world design.
